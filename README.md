# flight-price-pridiction

This is a project made by Aryam Bhardwaj. 
in this we use a lot of data preprocessing to clean raw data fetched from keggal

we use ml algorithm random forrest and take many user inputs of arrival date , departure date , no of stops , 
airline and then by our algorithm which dumps all algorithm output in a pkl file we fetch the data and predict an 
estimate of how much the flight will cost .

the project is then deployed with the help of flask framework.
